# Class Inheritance

This repository contains the Java code for an assignment where I have implemented three classes based on a class diagram:

Animal: Base class with age and gender fields, and isMammal() and mate() methods.
Fish: Subclass of Animal with a sizeInFeet field and a canEat() method (currently unused).
Zebra: Subclass of Animal with an is_wild field and a run() method.
